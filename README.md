# Pull Shark 
<img width="186" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3577d641-dd85-422f-aa0f-5b2fa13b3fe1" />

This badge indicates that the user has had two pull requests merged. In other words, simply open a branch and combine the work. Simply create a project and merge it twice.

## 1 Step 🎯
First, you need to create some repository and change it, if you want, it can be your own ReadMe. After that you will commit and put this option

<img width="486" height="552" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcbd4b5b-76c0-4117-969b-6c6f7ab8b5f6" />

<br>

## 2 Step 🎯
Then you will click on the green button to create a Pull request

<img width="851" height="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35266109-55b7-4d24-bb93-b5abe90015e6" />

<br>

## 3 Step 🎯
Finally, you will press this other green button. ⚠️ Important: You need to do this twice to get this achievement. ⚠️

<img width="853" height="440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74557262-b610-4e86-8f4f-99724c4a7f28" />

# Quickdraw
<img width="156" height="145" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f767c120-e8d7-44b6-a41b-1295dba2516d" />

You need to close an issue/pull request within 5 minutes of opening it. It's simple, easier than pull shark for some

## Step 1 🎯
Within 5 minutes you need to do the same steps as pull shark. However, in the last step you will click on the red icon and not the green one.

<img width="862" height="279" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32eba659-e629-40f3-9647-dcd12db58fe7" />

# Starstruck
<img width="170" height="156" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af80f51b-d92b-4b66-a771-e6907a3518e3" />

Unlike the other achievements, to get this one you need to have at least 16 stars in a repository.

## Step 1 🎯
Join the CollabStars Community on Discord, where we have a specific channel to post your repository and be able to get stars and help other people too.
See an example of a repository with more than 16 stars:

# Galaxy Brain
<img width="160" height="144" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f6d8412-c35a-4b5a-9f5d-a27c4748bff4" />

Correctly answer two discussions

## Step 1 🎯
On GitHub, within every repository, there's a tab called "Discussions," which contains several topics. You'll need to answer two questions on a specific topic, which I'll show you below.
If you are going to create a discussion, you will go to the repository settings and activate the discussions there.

<img width="955" height="853" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733c19d9-2003-4230-878b-b0dda5993836" />

<br>

## Step 2 🎯
This new tab will appear, and we will create a new discussion.

<img width="1670" height="674" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff900b5-7fbf-4d93-b217-f92cba6cb531" />

<br>

## Step 3 🎯
You'll select this option, choose the topic and description, and when someone answers correctly, you'll mark their answer as correct. To earn this achievement, you'll need to answer the questions. With that, you can go to discussions, look for this tab, and see what's available. Good luck!

# Pair Extraordinaire

coauthored commits on merged pull requests.

## Step 1 🎯
To get this achievement you will need a friend.  
First, we'll go to our repository normally as we did before, make any changes of your choice and put exactly what's here in the photo. However, you will of course put your friend's Nickname and email instead of the example mentioned.

## Step 2 🎯
After that you will create the pull request and merge it, just like you did with pull shark.

# Public Sponsor 
<img width="144" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d5edb8c-6c97-4353-b3de-48357440aa1f" />

Become a Sponsor

## Step 1 🎯
You need to create an account on Github Sponsors and enter your bank details and everything else and be approved. When approved, you will choose who to sponsor. When you do, you will be able to choose a monthly or one-time sponsorship and you will make the payment.
