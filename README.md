There are several achievements on Github, some are unfortunately still in the testing phase while two others cannot be obtained at the moment, but I will show each one.

This badge indicates that the user has had two pull requests merged. In other words, simply open a branch and combine the work. Simply create a project and merge it twice.

## 1 Step 🎯
First, you need to create some repository and change it, if you want, it can be your own ReadMe. After that you will commit and put this option

## 2 Step 🎯
Then you will click on the green button to create a Pull request

## 3 Step 🎯
Finally, you will press this other green button. ⚠️ Important: You need to do this twice to get this achievement. ⚠️

You need to close an issue/pull request within 5 minutes of opening it. It's simple, easier than pull shark for some

## Step 🎯
Within 5 minutes you need to do the same steps as pull shark. However, in the last step you will click on the red icon and not the green one.

# Highlight 
Highlights, unlike achievements, are not displayed as badges, but they are visible in another way on our profile, for example, see Developer Program Member . Not to mention that some, like Bug Bounty and Security, do not appear externally like the example above.
